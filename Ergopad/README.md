- The content of this folder is a collection of biometric data of the hands of selected people.
- The data is intended to create an average keyboard diagram.
- The collected data reflects only the right hand, therefore it will be mirrored
- The data was collected thanks to the Ergopad program (https://pashutk.com/ergopad/).
- The next step after averaging the results is to design the PCB layout and keyboard housing in the "Ergogen" generator - (https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen).
- The biometric averaged result is located in the "Result" subfolder.
